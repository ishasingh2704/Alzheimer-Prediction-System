# Models Directory

Place your trained machine learning model files here (e.g., .h5, .pkl, .pt, etc.).

- Example: `alzheimer_cnn_model.h5`
- Add documentation for model input/output formats as needed.

This folder is not tracked for large files by default. Use Git LFS or similar if storing large models in version control.
