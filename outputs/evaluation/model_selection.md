- **F1-Score (25%)**: Balance of precision and recall
- **CV Stability (15%)**: Model consistency across folds
- **Prediction Speed (10%)**: Deployment efficiency
- **Precision (10%)**: Critical for medical false positive control

### Final Scores
- **XGBoost**: 0.8762
- **Random Forest**: 0.8245
- **Decision Tree**: 0.8047
- **SVM**: 0.7469
- **Logistic Regression**: 0.6957


## Selected Model: XGBoost

### Performance Highlights
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.9528
- **F1-Score**: 0.9118
- **Cross-Validation**: 0.9665 ± 0.0056
- **Prediction Time**: 25.98 ms

### Key Advantages
- State-of-the-art gradient boosting performance
- Built-in regularization prevents overfitting
- Excellent handling of missing values
- High predictive accuracy


### Deployment Considerations
- Requires more hyperparameter tuning
- Less interpretable than simpler models


## Statistical Validation
- Performed paired t-tests on cross-validation scores between top models
- Applied Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (alpha = 0.0167)
- Conducted McNemar's tests on prediction disagreements

## Interpretability Analysis
- Generated SHAP values for feature importance analysis
- Identified top contributing features for model decisions
- Validated clinical relevance of important features

## Recommendation
**XGBoost** is recommended for production deployment based on its superior balance of predictive performance, interpretability, and deployment feasibility.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy model to production environment
2. Implement monitoring for model drift
3. Establish retraining pipeline
4. Develop risk scoring system based on model predictions
