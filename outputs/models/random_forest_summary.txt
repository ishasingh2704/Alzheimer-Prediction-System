Model: Random Forest (full)

Overall accuracy: 0.918 — the percentage of total cases the model predicted correctly.
Sensitivity (recall): 0.889 — how well the model detects positive cases (true positives).
Precision: 0.944 — how often a positive prediction is correct.
ROC AUC: 0.960 — overall ability to separate positive and negative cases.

Top features influencing predictions:
 - FunctionalAssessment: importance 0.226 (higher = more influence)
 - ADL: importance 0.183 (higher = more influence)
 - CognitiveDeclineScore: importance 0.159 (higher = more influence)
 - TotalSymptomCount: importance 0.065 (higher = more influence)
 - MemoryComplaints: importance 0.050 (higher = more influence)
 - CholesterolTriglycerides: importance 0.039 (higher = more influence)
 - BMI: importance 0.039 (higher = more influence)
 - CholesterolHDL: importance 0.038 (higher = more influence)
 - SleepQuality: importance 0.036 (higher = more influence)
 - CholesterolTotal: importance 0.035 (higher = more influence)

Interpretation guide: High sensitivity means fewer missed positive cases. High precision means fewer false positives.
