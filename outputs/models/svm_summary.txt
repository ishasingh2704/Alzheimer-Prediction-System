Model: SVM (full)

Overall accuracy: 0.863 — the percentage of total cases the model predicted correctly.
Sensitivity (recall): 0.880 — how well the model detects positive cases (true positives).
Precision: 0.851 — how often a positive prediction is correct.
ROC AUC: 0.928 — overall ability to separate positive and negative cases.

Top features influencing predictions:
 - FunctionalAssessment: importance 0.162 (higher = more influence)
 - ADL: importance 0.147 (higher = more influence)
 - CognitiveDeclineScore: importance 0.102 (higher = more influence)
 - MemoryComplaints: importance 0.058 (higher = more influence)
 - BehavioralProblems: importance 0.042 (higher = more influence)
 - TotalSymptomCount: importance 0.024 (higher = more influence)
 - CholesterolHDL: importance 0.018 (higher = more influence)
 - CholesterolTotal: importance 0.018 (higher = more influence)
 - CholesterolTriglycerides: importance 0.016 (higher = more influence)
 - SystolicBP: importance 0.015 (higher = more influence)

Interpretation guide: High sensitivity means fewer missed positive cases. High precision means fewer false positives.
